## Work in Progress


## Past Projects

- As part of my Programming & Problem Solving (ECS 36A) class, we had to create a text-based version of paint coded in C. Features implemented include quit, help, write, add, delete, resize, save, and load. Technical concepts embedded include pointers, structs, optional command line parameters, and make files. The project can be viewed here.

- Another project I worked on in my ECS 36A class was a "connect-n" game also coded in C. It is very similar to the classic connect-4 game, except the user gets to determine the board dimensions, and number of pieces needed to win. The project can be viewed here.
